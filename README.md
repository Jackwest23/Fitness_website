# Fitness_website

running wolf.co.za was a website i created as a personal project for myself to learn more of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Overall i enjoyed how much i learned and with the practise, i know alot more about website design. i did more different styles and tried to do a more impact visual and i did alotta better than before in my opinion. i also tried to a more complicated works in javascript such as adding a shopping cart and payment system. happy how it came out
